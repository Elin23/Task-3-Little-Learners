# Little Learners Academy - React + Vite Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get **React** working in **Vite** with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. Currently, this template includes only the **Home** page. Other pages are placeholders and will be added in the future.

### Available Pages:

- **Home**
- **About Us**
- **Academics**
- **Student Life**
- **Admission**
- **Contact**

## Official Plugins

This project uses the following official plugins for optimal performance:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh during development.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc): An alternative plugin using [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, designed to offer faster build speeds.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started with **Little Learners Academy**:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_folder>

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

Your project will now be live at http://localhost:3000.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Next Steps
Currently, only the Home page is available. Future pages (About Us, Academics, Student Life, Admission, Contact) will be added shortly.
